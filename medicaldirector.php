                                        <div class="text">Our health is the most important part of our lives, and often neglected too. It is the richest wealth any of us can possess. There is a harmony in being healthy, in functioning well. As they say, a sound mind dwells in a sound body. Every frame of our life achieves coherence only when our physical and mental health is maintained.</div>
                                    <div class="text">Diseases are not uncommon to us. It has been prevailing as long as us. But as we can observe, there has been a paradigm shift in the class of diseases that we are encountering. In the last couple of years, the disease burden across the world has had a steady shift from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases.</div>
                                    <div class="text">Diseases are not uncommon to us. It has been prevailing as long as us. But as we can observe, there has been a paradigm shift in the class of diseases that we are encountering. In the last couple of years, the disease burden across the world has had a steady shift from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases.</div>
                                    <div class="text">When before contagious diseases had occupied the stage, there has been an increase in chronic, communicable diseases recently and unfortunately more in developing countries like ours. More than 80% of deaths happen here, in developing countries. We bear the most burden. In 2008, five of the top ten causes of mortality worldwide, other than injuries, were non communicable diseases. Studies note that this might increase to a toll of seven by 2030, with 76% of total deaths caused by them. NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, lung disorders,diabetes and cancers are expected to cause three-fourth of the disease burden in low and middle-income countries by 2030.</div>
                                    <div class="text">NCDs not just harm the body, but also the mental state. They cause untold pain, suffering, disability and hardship for millions. Furthermore, these are a hit to the economy also. Both in terms of productivity and rising health care expenses, the costs are staggering. A World Bank study estimates an expense of $35 trillion from 2005 to 2030 on the global economy if suitable measures are not taken to reduce the overpowering of NCDs.</div>
                                    <div class="text">With ever increasing population, which will be a 20% hike as estimated, from 6.7 billion to 8.1 billion, there will be an increment in these diseases. The crude death rate will more or less remain stable at 8.4 deaths per thousand. The scenario in India is no different.</div>
                                    <div class="text">India has also seen a rapid transition in its disease burden (number of cases per lakh) over the past couple of decades. The load of communicable and non-communicable diseases is projected to get reversed in 2020 from its distribution in 19905. This is largely because, with India’s economic growth and urbanization over the past decades, a large section of the population has moved towards unhealthy lifestyles with decreasing physical activity, increasing stress levels, and increasing intake of saturated fats and tobacco.</div>
                                     <div class="text">However, a major shift is currently underway. A number of research and research training programs are working to address these health issues. All answers point out at the same thing – natural treatment. Naturopathy and Yoga can truly benefit us all when well practiced, applied and adopted. This is our aim – to make no further intermissions in addressing the root cause of this malady. To foster with the proper methods, and with conclusive results.</div>
                                      <div class="text">By being healthy, we are always inspirited. Being agile makes us useful to the social, economical and functional society of our nation. Let us arise in realisation and take the right steps. Nature is our best healer. It is our mother. Let us embrace its care.
