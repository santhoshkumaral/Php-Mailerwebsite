                                        <div class="text">During the last two hundred years, science and technology has become a significant factor in determining our everyday lives. We have to our credit such great inventions and discoveries that have made our lives more comfortable in the material realm. We are witnesses to mobile phones, techno companies, fast food joints, kindles and social networking websites.  But little do we know about the side effects. This growth of modern scientific endeavours demands a new form organization of things, a certain different lifestyle from us consumers, which is far more productive in terms of the physical gain that can be had, but is unfavourable to our health and wellness. Our eating, travelling and living habits are sour. Stress is an area of major concern now.</div>
                                        <div class="text">Case in point is the alarming increase of non communicable diseases. They have the potential to be malevolent killers. It is a known fact that our lifestyle is responsible for this; our sedentary lifestyle and our rich diet. So, maybe it will not matter that we have accomplished so much if we put our health at stake. Our health is the most important wealth to ourselves, our families and our nation. We must preserve it.
Looking back, we can see that our ancestors were wise and lived in harmony with nature. They based our civilisations on the five elements of nature,
and lived healthy and happy lives for many many years. We, must return to our roots. We need to adopt a more natural and healthy lifestyle that adapts to the advancements we have today. Our aim is to restore ourselves to that wellness through yoga and naturopathy.</div>
